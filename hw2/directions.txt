In the file human.fa you will find 13 human protein sequences in fasta format. In particular, in such a file each sequence entry starts with '>' telling you information about the following sequence that is formated by strings of 60 characters. Currently each entry is annoated by its gene name.

In the file protein-coding_gene.txt you will find more information about human genes and proteins. In particular, the file contains the information about gene names, their synonyms and gene location.

Write a python code that:

allows you to parse the information of the human.fa.
You need to get the information of synonyms and location by parsing the corresponding information from protein-coding_gene.txt.
As output, I want you to write a separate fasta file. In particular, the information of each entry should be formatted by writing > gene name|synonyms (separated by commas)|gene location.
Sequence information needs to be exactly like in human.fa (meaning sequence needs to be in blocks of 60 characters).
You need to write a python code to carry out this task. It is up to you if you want the code from scratch or use biopython functions.
As a deliverable you need to hand in your Python code.

As a second task, set up a BLAST search. Using the sequences in human.fa find the most homologous sequences to each human sequence in mouse. You need to:
set up a Python code that parses the human sequences,
iterates through each sequence,
searches a database with BLAST and
prints the human sequence ID, the mouse ID of the most similar homolog and the alignment, E-value and bitscore to a file of your choice.
Furthermore, you need to explain the choice of the (i) database you want to search, (ii) blast program, (iii) substitution matrix and (iv) choice of parameters.
As deliverables you need to hand in the python code, results file and description of choices

The assignment is due by midnight Friday Oct. 11th.
