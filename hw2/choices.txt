#			  					 --- REASONS FOR MY CHOICES ---
#
# DATABASE: 
#
#
# BLAST PROGRAM:	 blastp because it does Protein Query Searching
#						     	 a Protein Database
#								 
#	DATABASE: 			 "refseq_protein" because according to
#   							 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/proteins/
#									 RefSeq is indicated as having data for selected
#                  organisms (such as human, mouse and rat) are available
#										
# SUBST. MATRIX:   I picked BLOSUM45 because human and mouse are divergente evolutionary
#									 and because BLOSUM is based on local aligments
#
# PARAMETERS: 		 I used the additional parameters:
#					         - format_type="XML" so that the output is in
#									   XML format and can be parsed by NCBIXML easily
#									 - expect=0.001 so that only the hsp with
#									   expected values under 0.001 are considered
#
